Problem(CBP14):- Food Waste Reduction Solution
Category :- Clean and green Technology
Solution:- 
We have found a solution to reduce the wastage of food,mostly food is wasted due to excess preparation of food than needed and some of them are wasting food a lot by not eating it properly.
So, to solve this problem we have came out with a new idea by creating website to prevent the wastage of food by donating the excess of food that had left in the large gatherings like
Marriages,Functions and in any meetings etc. to the orphanages and homeless people who are suffering daily with hunger.This website helps people to find the charities or any 
orphanages to which they want to donate their excess amount of food which have been going to waste.To prevent the wastage of food, everyone need to be aware of food waste
management system.So, in one of the cases this website gives awareness on the food.
